    "### What's this ?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Grid2op package has been built with an \"object-oriented\" perspective: almost everything is encapsulated in a dedicated `class`. This allows for more customization of the plateform.\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside of this approach is that machine learning methods, especially in deep learning, often prefer to deal with vectors rather than with \"complex\" objects. Indeed, as we covered in the previous tutorials on the platform, we saw that building our own actions can be tedious and can sometime require important knowledge of the powergrid.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the contrary, in most of the standard Reinforcement Learning environments, actions have a higher level representation. For example in pacman, there are 4 different types of actions: \"turn left\", \"turn right\", \"go up\" and \"go down\". This allows for easy sampling (if you need to achieve an uniform sampling, you simply need to randomly pick a number between 0 and 3 included) and an easy representation: each action can be represented as a different component of a vector of dimension 4 [because there are 4 actions]. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, this representation is not \"human friendly\". It is quite convenient in the case of pacman because the action space is rather small, making it possible to remember which action corresponds to which component, but in the case of the grid2op package, there are hundreds or even thousands of actions. We suppose that we do not really care about this here, as tutorials on Reinforcement Learning with discrete action space often assume that actions are labeled with integers (such as in pacman for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting grid2op actions into \"machine readable\" ones is the major difficulty as there is no unique ways to do so. In grid2op we offer some pre defined \"functions\" to do so:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `BoxGymObsSpace` will convert the action space into a gym \"Box\". It is rather straightforward, especially for **continuous** type of actions (such as *redispatching*, *curtailment* or actions on *storage units*). Representing the discrete actions (on powerlines and on substation) is not an easy task with them. We would not recommend to use them if your focus is on topology. More information on https://grid2op.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gym.html#grid2op.gym_compat.BoxGymActSpace\n",
    "- `MultiDiscreteActSpace` is similar to `BoxGymObsSpace` but mainly focused on the **discrete** actions (*lines status* and *substation reconfiguration*). Actions are represented with a gym \"MultiDiscrete\" space. It allows to perform any number of actions you want (which might be illegal) but comes with little restrictions. It handles continuous actions through \"binning\" (which is not ideal but doable). We recommend using this transformation if the algorithm you want to use is able to deal with \"MultiDiscrete\" gym action type. More information is given at https://grid2op.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gym.html#grid2op.gym_compat.MultiDiscreteActSpace\n",
    "- `DiscreteActSpace` is similar to `MultiDiscreteActSpace` in the sense that it focuses on **discrete** actions. It comes with a main restriction though: you can only do one action. For example, you cannot \"modify a substation\" AND \"disconnect a powerline\" with the same action. More information is provided at https://grid2op.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gym.html#grid2op.gym_compat.DiscreteActSpace. We recommend to use it if you want to focus on **discrete** actions and the algorithm you want to use is not able to deal with `MultiDiscreteActSpace`.\n",
    "- You can also fully customize the way you \"represent\" the action. More information is given in the notebook [11_IntegrationWithExistingRLFrameworks](11_IntegrationWithExistingRLFrameworks.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section we will show an agent working with `DiscreteActSpace`. The code showed can be easily adapted with the other type of actions.\n",

    "\n",
    "A few notes here:\n",
    "- the meta parameters (\"net_arch\", \"learning_rate\", \"n_steps\", \"gamma\", \"batch_size\", ...) are not fine tuned and are unlikely to lead to good results\n",
    "- the number of training steps is way too low (it should be much greater, probably in >= 1M)\n",
    "- there is no \"heuristics\" embeded here. Agents performs best when they act only when the grid is \"in danger\" (otherwise it takes a while for an agent to learn to \"do nothing\")\n",
    "- we use a \"test\" environment, this is why we specified \"test=True\" at the environment creation.\n",
    "- observations are not scaled\n",
    "- reward is not tuned for a particular goal: default reward is used and this might not be a good things to do for the particular agent we are trying to build.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these probably lead to a quite terrible agent...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other important notes\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not recommend to train \"real\" model with such simple features. In particular, you might need to save (at different stage of training) your agent, log the progress using tensorboard (for example) etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done with \"callbacks\" here that are not covered in this \"getting started\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Yet another important note\n",
    "If you chose to use \"l2rpn baselines\" it will be as easy to learn an agent taking into account account all of the above if you us:\n",

    "And now, it is time to test the agent that we trained on different scenarios (ideally) using another environment (to mimic a real process)\n",
    "\n",
    "To do that, we have two main choices:\n",
    "1) we use the trained model, convert the other environment to a gym env, run the environment and ask for the neural network what it should od\n",
    "2) embed the trained neural network in a \"grid2op agent\" class and use the built grid2op runner transparently\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution 1) is to be preferred for \"quick and dirty\" tests. In all other cases we strongly recommend to use solution 2 as it also allows you to not recode the \"gym loop\" to benefit from the saving functionality (as so to be able to inspect your agent in grid2viz for example) etc.\n",

    "## IV) Improve your Agent \n",
    "\n",
    "As we stated above, the goal of this notebook was not to show a \"state of the art\" agent but rather to explain with a \"minimal example\" how you could get started into training an agent operating a powergrid.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve your agent, we strongly recommend to use the l2rpn_baselines repository, to fine tune the hyper parameters of your agents, to train it for longer on more diverse data, to use a different RL algorithm (maybe PPO is not the best one for this environment ?) etc. etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using some pre training (for example training the policy in a supervised fashion using heuristic of human demonstration data) might be a good solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another promising tool would be to use some \"curiculum learning\" where, at the beginning, the agent would interact with a simplified version of the environment (easier rules, no disconnection due to overflow, no cooldown after an action has been made,  etc.) and after some time, when the agent is starting to perform well to increase this difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet another possibility would be to access some kind of \"model based\" reinforcement learning, such as alpha-* models (*eg* alpha go)."
